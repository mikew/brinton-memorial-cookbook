# Cobb Salad

- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup Realemon lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp dry mustard
- 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder, optional
- 1/2 tsp lemon and pepper seasoning
- 6 cups shredded lettuce

- 2 cups finely chopped cooked chicken
- 3 hard-cooked eggs, finely chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- 1 avocado, seeded, peeled and chopped
- 1/4 cup blue cheese, crumbled
- 1/4 cup cooked, crumbled bacon

In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar and seasonings. Shake well and chill to blend flavours.

In a large salad bowl, arrange remaining ingredients. Chill. Just before serving, toss with dressing. Top with homemade croutons, if desired.

**Note:** This is a main dish salad. For use as a side salad, omit chicken.  I often add some shredded mozzarella or Parmesan cheese as well. Very filling and great for lunch.
