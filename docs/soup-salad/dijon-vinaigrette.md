# Dijon Vinaigrette

Elizabeth Oliver<br/>
Kagan Roy

- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard

- 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2/3 cup olive oil

Cut garlic cloves halfway through in several places (garlic cloves should remain in 1 piece). Put mustard and vinegar in cruet. Shake well. Add garlic and oil. Shake well again.

This is enough dressing for several salads of mixed greens. Salt and pepper greens to taste before adding dressing.
