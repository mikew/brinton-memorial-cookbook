Cindi Carnell<br/>
Gregory and Geoffrey Carnell

- 1 Tbsp butter
- 2 Tbsp chopped onion
- 1 tsp chives
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- 1 cup milk

- Dash Tabasco sauce
- 1/2 cup tomato bisque soup
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 cup cooked lobster
- 1 cup light cream

In medium saucepan, cook onion in butter until tender. Stir in chives, bouillon cube, milk and Tabasco sauce. Cook until steaming hot. Stir in soup and lemon juice. Heat thoroughly, stirring constantly. Add lobster and cream. Reheat. Do not boil. Garnish with floating, cooked puff pastry shape and a swirl of cream.

**Note:** Soup may appear curdled after lemon juice is added to milk.  Further cooking and addition of cream result in a smooth soup.
