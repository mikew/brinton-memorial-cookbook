- 1 tall can salmon
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 4 Tbsp flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 2 cups milk

Make a white sauce by melting butter. Add flour and stir over moderate heat for 3 minutes. After mixture begins to bubble, add salt and pepper.  Gradually add milk, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth and thickened. Grease a casserole dish. Put a layer of potato slices, a layer of salmon and a layer of sauce. Continue layering in order until all is used. Top with bread crumbs and butter. Bake at 375Â°F for approximately 30 minutes.

This recipe belonged to the girls' great-grandmother and is something to help initiate young interest in cooking.
