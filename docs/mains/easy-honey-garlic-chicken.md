- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup soya sauce

- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 chicken, cut up

Arrange chicken in a baking pan. Layer remaining ingredients. Cover and bake at 350Â°F for 1 1/2 hours. Uncover the last 10 minutes. Baste, if desired. If skinless chicken is used, extra water may be required to avoid burning.
