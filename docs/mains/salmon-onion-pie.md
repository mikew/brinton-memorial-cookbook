Pâte Brisée (French Pastry):

- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 Tbsp shortening
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 5 to 6 Tbsp water

Filling:

- 2 lb onions, finely cubed
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup cultured sour cream
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1 can salmon
- 2 tsp dill seed (very important)

**Pâte Brisée:** Combine butter, shortening, salt and flour in a large glass bowl. First use a pastry blender, then a fork to work the ingredients together. Make a well in the center. Add water and toss the ingredients together until they are moist enough to hold together. Roll out between 2 sheets of wax paper and place in a 9 inch pie pan. Prick and chill while preparing filling. Brush pie shell with beaten egg.

**Filling:** Heat onions in butter, just until butter is melted. Remove from heat. Combine and heat slowly all remaining ingredients. Stir into onion mixture. Place mixture in pie shell. Bake at 450°F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300°F and bake until crust has browned. Serve hot. May be made previous day and heated. Serve with rice and stuffed baked fish or chicken.
