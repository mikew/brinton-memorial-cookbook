- 1 lb ground beef or turkey
- 1 egg, optional
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 1/3 cup stock or water
- 1 Tbsp nutritional yeast

- 1/4 tsp thyme
- 1 clove garlic, minced, optional
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste Cornmeal, for coating

Combine all ingredients, except cornmeal and form into patties. Coat patties with cornmeal. The egg can be omitted, but the patties will break more easily, especially if they are barbecued. Makes 6 to 7 patties.
