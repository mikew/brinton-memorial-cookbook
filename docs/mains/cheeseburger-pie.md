- Pastry for 9 inch pie crust
- 1 lb ground beef
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1/2 cup bread crumbs
- 4 oz can tomato sauce
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup diced green pepper

Cheese Topping:

- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 tsp dry mustard
- 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Cook ground beef until browned. Drain fat, then stir in remaining ingredients, except pastry. Pour into unbaked 9 inch pastry shell.

**Cheese Topping:** Mix all ingredients together.

Spread Cheese Topping evenly over meat mixture and bake at 400Â° F for about 30 minutes. Edges of pastry can be covered with foil to prevent excessive browning.
