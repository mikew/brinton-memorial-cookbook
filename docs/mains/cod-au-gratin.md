- 1 lb cod fillets, cut into pieces
- Butter
- 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
- 1 1/2 cups chopped celery
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms, optional
- 1 cup chopped green pepper
- 1/4 cup butter

- 1/4 cup flour
- 1/2 tsp salt, or less
- 2 cups milk
- 1 to 2 cups bread crumbs
- 1 to 2 Tbsp melted butter
- 1/2 cup finely grated sharp cheddar cheese

Melt butter and pan-fry celery, onion, mushrooms and green pepper until partially cooked. Set aside.

Make a medium cream sauce. In medium saucepan, melt 1/4 cup butter and add flour and salt, mixing well. Gradually add milk over medium heat until nicely thickened. Add cod and partially cooked vegetables.  Combine thoroughly, then transfer to a greased casserole dish. Top with lots of buttered crumbs. Bake at 375Â°F for 30 minutes, or until bubbling.  Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese during last 5 minutes of baking.

To serve as an appetizer, bake in individual appetizer dishes.

Scallops can be substituted for cod. Follow same procedure. Makes a very tasty seafood dish.
