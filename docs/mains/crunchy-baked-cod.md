- 1 lb fresh fillet
- 1/2 to 3/4 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tsp prepared mustard

- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 1/2 cups crushed crackers

Cut fish into 4 to 5 inch pieces. Mix together mayonnaise and mustard.  Place milk, flour and crumbs in separate flat bowls. Dip fish in milk, then in flour, then in the mayonnaise mixture and then in the crumbs. Pat each piece so that the crumbs adhere firmly. Fish can be baked immediately, or refrigerated until baking time. Bake in a preheated 425Â°F oven on a large greased pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway through baking.
