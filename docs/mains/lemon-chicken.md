- 3 1/2 Ib chicken, cut into 10 pieces
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- Flour, for dredging

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 3 cups thinly sliced onions
- 1 1/2 Tbsp thinly sliced garlic
- 8 fresh thyme sprigs
- 1 1/2 cups chicken stock
- 2 lemons

Season chicken with 1/2 of the salt and pepper 1 1/2 hours before serving. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Dredge chicken in flour. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 10 inch skillet and brown chicken pieces on both sides. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.

Discard fat from skillet and heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add onions and garlic and cook over moderate heat for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until very soft and lightly browned. Add thyme, chicken pieces and stock. Cut 1 lemon into 10 slices and place 1 slice on each piece of chicken. Squeeze juice from other lemon and pour over chicken.  Bring to a simmer on the stove. Cover and put in oven for 15 minutes.  Uncover and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes, basting every 10 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes and serve.
