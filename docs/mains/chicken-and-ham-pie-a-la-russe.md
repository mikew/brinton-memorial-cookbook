- 5 to 6 oz cooked chicken, chopped
- 3 to 4 oz cooked ham, cubed
- 5 oz cheddar cheese, cubed
- 3 oz mushrooms, chopped

- 1 Tbsp chopped parsley
- Salt and ground pepper
- 1 egg, beaten, to bind
- 8 oz frozen puff pastry
- 1 egg, beaten, for glazing

Mix together chicken, ham, cheese, mushrooms and parsley. Season to taste. Stir 1 beaten egg into mixture. Roll pastry thinly into a 12 inch square. Place on a baking tray. Pile filling in center. Fold corners to the center and pinch seams. Brush 1 beaten egg all over the pie. Prick with fork to let steam escape. Bake in a preheated 425°F oven for 25 minutes, until well risen and golden brown. Serve hot, garnished with tomato quarters and fresh watercress, or serve with a salad.
