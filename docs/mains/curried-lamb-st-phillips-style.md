- 1 small can tomato paste

- 1 cup water
- 1 lb lamb, cut into 1 inch cubes
- 1 large can stewed tomatoes
- 2 Knorr chicken bouillon cubes
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Saut√© onions, curry powder and lamb in a large pot with vegetable oil.  Cook until medium brown. Lower heat and add tomatoes, paste, bouillon cubes and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, until lamb is tender. Season to taste. Check consistency of liquid at 20 minute intervals. Add water as needed to keep lamb from drying out. When cooked, serve with rice, raisins, walnuts, banana and orange slices. Serves 6.
