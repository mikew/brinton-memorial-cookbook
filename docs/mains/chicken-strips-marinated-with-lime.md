- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Juice of 1 lime
- 3 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp sugar

- 1 tsp dried chervil
- Pinch cayenne pepper
- Pinch salt
- 1 clove garlic, whole not minced

Place all ingredients, except chicken, in a small frying pan. Heat gently, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Slice chicken into 2 inch long strips, about 1/2 inch wide. Place chicken in a small dish. Pour heated mixture over and marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes.

Broil chicken 4 inches from heat for 4 to 5 minutes, or until tender and no longer pink inside. If chicken breasts are very large, double marinade ingredients.
