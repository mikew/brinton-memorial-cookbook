Place chicken breasts between strips of wax paper and pound until 1/4 inch thick. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon oregano, garlic salt and pepper in shallow bowl or pie plate. In a small bowl, stir together butter, parsley and 1/2 teaspoon oregano. Spread butter mixture on flattened chicken breasts. Place a mozzarella cheese slice on each buttered chicken breast. Roll up each chicken breast, folding in sides to enclose filling. Secure with a toothpick. Dip bundle in melted butter, then roll in bread crumb mixture. Place bundles, seam side down and not touching each other, in a baking pan. Refrigerate for about 4 hours. Bake, uncovered, at 425Â°F for 20 minutes. Makes about 8 servings.
