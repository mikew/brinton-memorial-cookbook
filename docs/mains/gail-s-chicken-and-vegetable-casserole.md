- 3 1/2 cups cooked chicken
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 2 cups diced vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower)
- 1 can sliced water chestnuts
- 2 Tbsp minced onion
- 2 tsp garlic

- 1/2 cup mayonnaise or Miracle Whip
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- Splash lemon juice
- 1 or 2 cups cheddar cheese
- Corn flake crumbs

Mix together all ingredients, except cheese and corn flake crumbs. Add milk, if necessary, as it is better to have it a little more moist than dry.  Pour into large casserole dish. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese and cover with corn flake crumbs. Top with paprika. Bake at 350Â°F for 40 minutes.  Serves 5 to 8.
