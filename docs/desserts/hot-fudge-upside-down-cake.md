Lucy and Elinor Barker

- 1 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 Tbsp cocoa
- 1/2 cup milk
- 4 Tbsp melted butter

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 1/4 cup cocoa
- 1 3/4 cups very hot water

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Whisk together flour, baking powder, 3/4 cup white sugar, salt and 3 tablespoons cocoa. Add milk, butter and vanilla, stirring until mixture is smooth, dark and well blended. Pour into a 9 inch square ungreased pan.

In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup cocoa. Sprinkle evenly over batter. Pour hot water over batter, but do not stir. Bake for 40 minutes. Mixture forms both a cake and a sauce in the pan. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
