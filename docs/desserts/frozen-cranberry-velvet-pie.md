Vicki Colbourne<br/>

- 1 1/4 cups fine vanilla wafer crumbs
- 6 Tbsp butter or margarine, melted
- 8 oz pkg cream cheese, softened

- 1 cup whipping cream
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 16 oz can whole cranberry sauce

Combine crumbs and melted butter. Press firmly onto bottom and side of buttered 9 inch pie plate. Chill until firm. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Combine whipping cream, sugar and vanilla. Whip until thickened, but not stiff. Gradually add to cream cheese, beating until smooth and creamy.

Set aside a few whole cranberries from sauce for garnish. Fold remaining cranberry sauce into whipped mixture. Spoon into chilled crust. Freeze until firm. Remove from freezer for 10 minutes before serving.

To serve, top with additional whipped cream and reserved whole cranberries. A great make ahead.

I often substitute graham wafer crumbs for fine vanilla wafer crumbs.  Works fine.
