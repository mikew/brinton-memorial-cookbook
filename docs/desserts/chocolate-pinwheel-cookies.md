- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 egg

Cream butter. Gradually add sugar and cream well. Add egg and vanilla and beat well. Mix flour with salt and baking soda and stir into batter.  Divide in half. Add cocoa to colour 1/2 of the batter. Roll out to a rectangle 1/8 inch thick. Do same with other 1/2 of the batter. Lay one on the other and roll up jelly roll fashion. Cover tightly with wax paper and chill until firm. To bake, slice thinly and bake on greased sheets at 350Â°F for approximately 10 minutes. Cool on racks.
