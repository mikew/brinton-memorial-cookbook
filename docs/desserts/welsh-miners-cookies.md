- 1 cup margarine, softened
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup flour, sifted
- 1 tsp baking soda

- 1/2 tsp ground cloves
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 cup currants
- 1/4 cup milk

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease cookie sheets. Cream margarine in a bowl to about the consistency of mayonnaise. Beat in sugar, then rolled oats, flour, baking soda and spices. Stir in milk and currants. Shape into balls. Place on sheets 3 inches apart. Flatten slightly by pressing with the bottom of a glass dipped in water. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden. Cool on wire racks. Makes about 4 dozen cookies.

**Tip:** Baking for a shorter time gives soft chewy cookies. Baking longer makes them tender crisp. Experiment to find what you like best.
