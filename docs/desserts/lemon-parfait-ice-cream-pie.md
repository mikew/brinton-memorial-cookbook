- 1 cup graham wafer crumbs
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 3 Tbsp butter, melted
- 2 eggs, slightly beaten
- 1 cup sugar

- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 tsp grated lemon rind
- 1/4 cup lemon juice

Combine the first 3 ingredients. Toss. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the crumb mixture. Press remaining mixture into a 9 inch pie plate. Bake at 350Â°F for 8 to 10 minutes. Cool.

In a small saucepan, combine eggs, sugar, 1/4 cup butter, lemon rind and juice. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth and thickened. Do not boil. Cool.

Spoon 1/2 of the ice cream into pie shell. Cover with 1/2 of the lemon sauce. Repeat layers. Sprinkle reserved crumbs over top. Freeze until firm. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
