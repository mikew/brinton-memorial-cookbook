- 1 cup butter (no substitutes)
- 2 cups flour

- 1/2 cup fruit sugar
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar

Cut butter into dry ingredients with a pastry blender. Press together with hands. Roll out thinly, about 1/3 inch thick and cut out with a cookie cutter or small, round sharp object (1/2 of a tea ball is ideal). Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 300Â°F for 20 to 30 minutes, until done.
