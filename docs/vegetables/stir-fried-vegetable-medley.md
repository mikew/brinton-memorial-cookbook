- 2 celery stalks
- 1 medium onion
- 1 large bunch broccoli
- 1/2 lb large mushrooms

- 1/4 cup salad oil, or less
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar

Cut each carrot crosswise into 2 or 3 pieces, then lengthwise into matchstick thin strips. Cut each celery stalk crosswise into 3 pieces, then lengthwise into matchstick thin strips. Thinly slice onion. Cut broccoli into about 2x1 inch flowerettes. Cut mushrooms into quarters (or halves if small).

In wok, or 12 inch skillet, over high heat, in hot oil, cook carrots, celery, onion and broccoli, stirring quickly and frequently for 3 to 4 minutes. Add mushrooms, water, salt and sugar. Cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes longer, until vegetables are tender crisp, stirring occasionally. Yield: 6 servings.
