- 6 carrots, cut into strips
- 3 small zucchini, cut into semi-circles
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cup seasoned croutons
- 2 Tbsp cornstarch

- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1/4 cup margarine
- 1 tsp salt, or less
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp dried basil

Cook carrots in boiling salted water until tender crisp. Drain. In 1 quart shallow baking dish, toss vegetables and croutons. Meanwhile, in saucepan, stir together cornstarch and milk until smooth. Add margarine, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Boil for 1 minute. Add basil and pour over vegetable mixture. Bake in a 350Â°F oven for about 25 minutes.

Carrots and sauce may be cooked in microwave easily. May be made ahead of time, leaving croutons out until time of baking.
