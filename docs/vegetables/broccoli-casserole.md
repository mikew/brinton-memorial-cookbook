- 2 pkg frozen broccoli, chopped
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 can mushroom soup

- 1/2 cup salad dressing
- 1 cup grated cheddar cheese
- Herbed stuffing mix
- 1/4 cup melted butter

Cook broccoli and drain. Combine eggs, onion, soup and salad dressing to make a sauce. Place a layer of broccoli in a casserole dish. Add a layer of cheese. Pour a small amount of sauce on top. Repeat layers until all are used. Completely cover with stuffing mix. Sprinkle melted butter over top. Bake at 350Â° for 45 minutes, until top is golden brown and crisp. If herbed stuffing mix is not available, coarsely grated bread crumbs serve the purpose.
