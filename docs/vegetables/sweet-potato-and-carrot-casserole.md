- 5 sweet potatoes
- 12 carrots
- 3/4 cup orange juice
- 2 Tbsp honey
- 2 tsp cinnamon, optional
- 2 cloves garlic, minced, optional

Topping:

- 1 1/2 cups fine bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans
- 1/3 cup melted butter
- 1 Tbsp chopped parsley

Peel and chop carrots and sweet potatoes. Boil for about 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and mash together well (can use a blender). Add orange juice, honey, cinnamon and garlic. Mix to blend. Spread mixture in a greased 13x9 inch pan.

Combine ingredients for topping in a bowl. Mix well. Sprinkle over top of sweet potato mixture. Bake in a 350Â°F oven until heated through. Serves 8 to 10.

**Note:** This dish can be prepared in advance. Cover with foil after putting on topping and heat when needed. Great accompaniment for beef or chicken.
