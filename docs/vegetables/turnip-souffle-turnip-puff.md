- 2 lb turnip (1 medium turnip)
- 2 cups lightly salted chicken stock
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1/8 tsp freshly ground pepper

- 1/8 tsp ground mace or nutmeg
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 eggs, separated
- Salt
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs

Peel turnip and chop into 1/2 inch cubes. Place in a saucepan with stock.  Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain, reserving stock for another use, such as soup. Mash turnips very well. There should be about 3 cups. Add 2 tablespoons butter, brown sugar, pepper, mace, baking powder and egg yolks. Stir well to blend ingredients. Taste. Add salt, if desired. Melt 3 tablespoons butter. Add crumbs and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry. Fold into turnip mixture. Spoon into a buttered soufflé dish. Sprinkle with buttered crumbs. Bake at 375°F for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned on top.
