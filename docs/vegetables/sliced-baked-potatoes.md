# Sliced Baked Potatoes

Elizabeth Andrews
Grade 3 Teacher

- 4 medium even potatoes
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 to 3 Tbsp melted butter

- 2 to 3 Tbsp chopped fresh herbs e.g. parsley, chives, thyme or sage, or 2 to 3 tsp dried herbs of your choice
- 4 Tbsp grated cheddar cheese
- 1 1/2 Tbsp Parmesan cheese

Peel potatoes if the skin is tough, otherwise just scrub and rinse. Cut potatoes into thin slices, but not all the way through. Put a handle of a spoon beside the potato to prevent the knife from cutting all the way through. Put potatoes into a baking dish. Fan them slightly. Sprinkle with salt and drizzle with butter. Sprinkle with herbs. Bake potatoes at 425Â°F for about 50 minutes. Remove from oven. Sprinkle with cheeses. Bake potatoes for another 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned, cheeses are melted and potatoes are soft inside. Check with a fork.

Good served with any meat, fish or poultry dish or as a main dish with just a salad. Makes 4 servings.
