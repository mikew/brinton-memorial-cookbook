- 6 to 7 large potatoes (2 lb)
- 1/4 cup chopped onion
- 3 Tbsp butter or margarine
- 3 Tbsp flour
- 1 1/2 tsp salt

- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 2 1/2 cups milk
- 1 1/2 cups cheese, medium or old

**Sauce:** In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in milk, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes, until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in about 1/2 cup cheese, until melted.

Peel and slice potatoes and arrange 1/3 in a greased baking dish. Pour 1/3 of the sauce over potatoes. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the onion. Repeat layers twice. Cover and bake at 350Â°F for 45 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes more. Serves 8.
