- 3 lb potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

- 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups hot water
- Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish, optional

Toss potatoes with lemon juice, oil, salt, pepper, oregano and garlic in a flat 8x12 inch baking dish. Let sit to marinate for about an hour. Add water. Bake, uncovered, at 325Â°F for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours (depending on the size of the potato cubes). Stir occasionally and add water if necessary to prevent sticking. Be careful not to burn potatoes during the last 30 minutes. Do not add any water during the last 15 to 20 minutes.  When baking is finished, there should not be any water left in the baking dish. Garnish with parsley, if desired and serve. Serves a crowd.
