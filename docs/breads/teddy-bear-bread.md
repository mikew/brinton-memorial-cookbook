- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1/2 cup cornmeal
- 1/2 cup cooking molasses
- 1/3 cup margarine
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp yeast

- 2 eggs
- 3 cups boiling water
- 8 cups flour, approximately
- 1 egg white
- 1 Tbsp water

Combine the first 5 ingredients and add boiling water. Let cool to lukewarm. Combine yeast with 3 cups flour. Combine cornmeal mixture and flour mixture. Add eggs. Mix well. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly greased bowl.  Allow to rise until doubled in bulk.

Punch down. Divide dough into thirds. Grease large cookie sheets.  Combine egg white with water. Cut 1/3 section of dough in half. Shape 1 piece into a large ball for body and place on cookie sheet. Flatten slightly. Cut other piece in half. Shape 1 piece into a small ball. Brush 1 side with egg white mixture. Arrange small ball, with egg white mixture side next to large ball, tucking slightly under, for bear's head. Shape remaining piece into a 6 inch rope. Cut a 2 inch piece for the snout.  Pinch small piece for nose. Brush bottom of pieces with egg white mixture. Place snout on head near body and place nose on top of snout.  Cut remaining piece into 6 pieces to shape 4 legs and 2 ears. Using egg white mixture to attach each piece, tuck ears, arms and legs under bear.  With kitchen shears, snip to fashion fingers, toes and eyes. With tip of shears, make belly button in center of body. Repeat with remaining dough to make 3 bears in all.

Cover with towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Gently brush bears with egg white mixture. Place cookie sheets on 2 oven racks and bake for 15 minutes. Switch cookie sheets between upper and lower racks. Bake for about 10 minutes longer, until bread turns brown and sounds hollow when lightly tapped. Remove bears from cookie sheets and cool on wire racks.
