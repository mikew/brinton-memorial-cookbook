- 2 eggs
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 cup mashed over ripe bananas

Cream together margarine, sugar and eggs in a large bowl. Add flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Combine and mix gently. Stir in mashed bananas and nuts until batter is wet. Preheat oven to 350°F.  Place batter in a greased loaf pan. Bake at 350°F for 1 hour. Insert toothpick in center, it should come out clean when done.

**Note:** This recipe doubles well, but only use 3 large eggs for best results.
