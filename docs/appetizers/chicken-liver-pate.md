- 1/4 cup butter or margarine
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 lb chicken livers, drained
- 6 to 8 medium mushrooms, chopped

- 1/3 cup cold butter

- 2 Tbsp dark rum
- Large pinch white pepper
- Large pinch cloves
- Large pinch dry ginger

Melt butter and gently sauté onion. Do not brown. Add livers and cook until most of redness disappears, but some pink remains. Add mushrooms and wine. Cover and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until cooked, but not hard and dry. Put in blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and blend well. Adjust seasonings to taste. Refrigerate at least 1 day. Serve at room temperature.
