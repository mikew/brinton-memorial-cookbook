- 2 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup grated cheddar
- 1 cup cooked bacon
- 1/4 cup chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, crushed

- 1 cup margarine, softened
- 1 pkg frozen spinach, cooked and drained

Mix the first 8 ingredients together in a bowl. Slice the top off the loaf and dig out bread, creating a large hole. Fill loaf with cream cheese mixture and place top back on top. Double wrap in tin foil and bake on a cookie sheet at 325Â°F for 2 hours. Serve immediately with crackers and left over bread.
