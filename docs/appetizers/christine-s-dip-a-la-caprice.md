- 250 g pkg cream cheese
- 3/4 to 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3/4 cup finely chopped red onion

- 2 cups grated strong old cheddar cheese

Soften cream cheese and combine with mayonnaise until well blended (use mixer). Add finely chopped red onion. Grate cheese and add. Put into ovenproof dish. Place in 350°F oven and heat until browned or bubbling, about 15 to 20 minutes.

This will keep for 2 days in the refrigerator. Just heat when ready to serve. Melba Toast, mini Paris toasts and French bread go well with this dip. Always a hit and so easy to prepare.
