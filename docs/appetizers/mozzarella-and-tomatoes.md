- 1 lb real Italian mozzarella cheese*
- 1 lb tomatoes, approximately
- Lots of fresh basil leaves

- 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil, approximately
- Pepper and salt

Cut mozzarella cheese into slices about 3 to 5 mm thick. Spread them out on a large plate. Arrange tomato slices on top. Sprinkle with oil and spices. Shortly before serving, sprinkle all the basil leaves on top. Do not cut the basil with a metal knife as this would destroy the basil taste.

\* The kind you can get here that gets closest in consistency is the brand Saputo called Bocconcini.
